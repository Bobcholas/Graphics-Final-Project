# Graphics-Final-Project

Particle System:
This particle system has several features:
interchangeable texture mapping
rudimentary physics
blending
multiple particle emitters
billboarding

It consists of particle managers, which update and reset particles as their life decays. The properties of the particles, such as the speed of the particle emissions or the initial position of the emitter can be adjusted on the creation of a particle manager. 

A list of these manager is in new, which handles openGL operations for this particle system as well.
